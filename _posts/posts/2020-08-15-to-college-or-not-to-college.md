Every year, high school seniors across America are faced with their most impact economic question: is going to college is worth the cost. With Covid-19 causing an unprecedented economic shutdown, a record number of unemployed adults, and Universities going online yet refusing to lower tuition fees; the question of the worth of attending college has never been more relevant. When I was personally going through the college admissions process, I was too busy just trying to get into college. I never bothered asking myself why I should go to college at all. A half decade after finishing college and now I'm going back to discover the limits of when person should go or not go to college.
